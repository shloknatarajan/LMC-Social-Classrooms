                    <h1>The Problem</h1>
                    <p>In a society more connected than ever, students at many universities feel isolated and alone. In 2018, Georgia Tech conducted a survey of around 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The results weren’t great: over half of all students who responded reported feeling isolated from others. Even more extreme, about 4 in 10 students reported feeling like they don’t have any friends [1].

                <div id="purpose">
                    <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
                    <p>We want to change the way classes are structured to include facilitated human interaction without compromising on quality of learning. We provide ideas and examples for teachers to follow so that they can bring interaction to their classrooms.

                    <h1>General Ideas</h1>
                    <p><b>Group Projects: </b>These are a common way of getting students to work together and are a frequent way students make friends with one another. One issue students have with these is when there’s an uneven distribution of work among the group, but this issue can be mitigated by making the results of the group project extra credit or part of a competition. That way there’s less pressure of one of your partners hurting your grade.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Study Groups: </b>It can be tough for students to reach out to others in the class (especially when classes are online) to form a study group. To help with this, teachers can create and assign students to study groups and encourage learning together. This can be especially helpful in flipped classroom environments where students watch lectures online ahead of time and then come to class for problem sets. Instead of having students join class and work through in-class problems completely on their own, you can have students join and then break off into their study groups to go through the in-class examples together.</p>

                            <li>Overview: This was a completely online class that utilized a semi-flipped classroom structure. There were short lecture videos (less than 20 minutes a night) to watch ahead of time with the class times being divided between instruction and problem sets. For the problem sets, students were given a problem in a PDF as well as some clarification explanations and then sent off into break out rooms to work with an assigned group to finish it. A TA would regularly join the break out room to answer any questions and make sure students were on track.

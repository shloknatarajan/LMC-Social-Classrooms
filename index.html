                    <p>In a society more connected than ever, students at many universities feel isolated and alone. In 2018, Georgia Tech conducted a survey (<a href="https://healthinitiatives.gatech.edu/spring-2018-mental-health-well-being-population-data">Results</a>) of around 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The results weren’t great: over half of all students who responded reported feeling isolated from others. Even more extreme, about 4 in 10 students reported feeling like they don’t have any friends.

                    <p>It may seem counter-intuitive to talk about socialization within classrooms since classrooms are supposed to be a place of learning, but with students spending a majority of their times in class if they aren't able to make friends within their learning environments they may not be making friends at all, and the data supports this. We want to change the way classes are structured to include facilitated human interaction without compromising on quality of learning. We provide ideas and examples for teachers to follow so that they can bring interaction to their classrooms. Decreasing feelings of loneliness is critical in tackling the <a href="https://www.jedfoundation.org/survey-of-college-student-mental-health-in-2020/">student mental health crisis</a> could have a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4443903/#:~:text=Results%20showed%20that%20mental%20health,did%20not%20improve%20or%20worsened."> positive impact on academic performance.</a>

                    <h1>General Ideas</h1>
                    <p><b>Group Projects: </b>These are a common way of getting students to work together and are a frequent way students make friends with one another. Peer evaluations can also be conducted upon the project's conclusion for better understanding of workload distribution.</p>
                    <p><b>Using Group and Invidual Tasks: </b> Combining group projects with individual assessments could facilitate social interaction while still assessing every student accurately.</p>
                    <p><b>Presentations: </b> Presentations done in groups or individually are naturally interactive and allow for professors to provide follow up questions to the students to improve assessment of desired learning outcomes.</p>
                    <p><b>Group Competitions: </b>Rather than attaching grades to group work (in-case you are afraid of unequal workload distribution skewing grades), assign bonus points or some other incentive to get students to work together. This could be included within your currently lesson plan without changing grade breakdowns significantly.</p>
                    <p><b>Study Groups: </b>It can be tough for students to reach out to others in the class (especially when classes are online) to form a study group. To help with this, teachers can create and assign students to study groups and encourage learning together. This can be especially helpful in flipped classroom environments where students watch lectures online ahead of time and then come to class for problem sets. Instead of having students join class and work through in-class problems completely on their own, you can have students join and then break off into their study groups to go through the in-class examples together.</p>
                    <p><b>Outside of Class Events: </b>Incentivize students to attend events related to the content outside of class. This allows for no change to current content but also increases chances of students talking with one another.</p>

                        <h4>CS 3510: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h3>
                        <p><b>Instructors:</b> Prof. Jacob Abernathy and Prof. Gerandy Brito</p>
                        <p><b>Where:</b> Georgia Tech</p>
                        <p><b>When:</b> Fall 2020</p>
                        <p><b>Description:</b> This was a completely online class that utilized a semi-flipped classroom structure. There were short lecture videos (less than 20 minutes a night) to watch ahead of time with the class times being divided between instruction and problem sets. For the problem sets, students were given a problem in a PDF as well as some clarification explanations and then sent off into break out rooms to work with an assigned group to finish it. A TA would regularly join the break out room to answer any questions and make sure students were on track.</p>
                        <p><b>Key Takeaways:</b> The primary strategy the class used to create student interaction was the class assigning study groups to each student. This automatically "broke the ice" between students as students needed to work together to solve in-class problems with TA oversight.</p>
                        
                        <h4>INTA 4014: Scenario Writing and Path Gaming</h3>
                        <p><b>Instructors:</b> Prof. Michael Salomone & Prof.Jenna Jordan</p>
                        <p><b>Where:</b> Georgia Tech</p>
                        <p><b>When:</b> Spring 2018</p>
                        <p><b>Description:</b> The first part of this class guided students through the creation of original futures scenarios centered around various aspects of cyber-security coordination. The second portion of this class engaged students in a path game which is a competitive exercise performed by students organized into teams in which the participants attempt to fashion domestic and international policies while negotiating treaties and agreements amongst all teams involved. Students were graded through daily individual quizzes, classroom discussion participation, as well as on the group projects.</p>
                        <p><b>Key Takeaways:</b> The class was split into two blocks with the first of which involved more individual participation. This allows for a more fair assessment of the students’ individual learning at the beginning. After learning the critical content, students were then put into group project activities but still received individual quizzes. This allows for accurate assessments of the students while still introducing social elements within the class.</p>
                        
                        <h4>CS 6265: Information Security Lab</h3>
                        <p><b>Instructors:</b> Prof. Taesoo Kim</p>
                        <p><b>Where:</b> Georgia Tech</p>
                        <p><b>When:</b> Summer 2021</p>
                        <p><b>Syllabus:</b> <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/course_page_docs/syllabi/cs_6265_syllabus_and_schedule_2021-2.pdf">CS 6252 Syllabus</a></p>
                        <p><b>Description:</b> Purpose of this class is to cover advanced techniques for writing exploits and patching vulnerabilities, taught through an intense, hands-on security laboratory. A significant part of this course involves solving Capture-The-Flag (CTF) and discussing strategies for solving such problems. This course covers a variety of topics including (but not limited to) reverse engineering, exploitation, binary analysis, and web. Course grading is done through homework and in person lab assignments (no-midterms).
                        <p><b>Key Takeaways:</b> While there isn’t a substantial amount of group work in class times, this class is very closely associated with the Capture-the-Flag club at Georgia Tech. Students within the class are encouraged to join the CTF club and often times do start attending the club with their peers. By creating a close pipeline between a class and a club, the teachers have effectively created a social environment attached to the class without having to make changes to content delivery. </p></p>
                        
                        <h4>CS 2701: Startup Lab</h3>
                        <p><b>Instructors:</b> Prof. Henry Owens</p>
                        <p><b>Where:</b> Georgia Tech (Study Abroad - Berlin)</p>
                        <p><b>When:</b> Summer 2019</p>
                        <p><b>Description:</b> This class is an introduction to technology ventures/startups. Different elements of technology venture creation including opportunity identification and validation, ideation, customer discovery, market analysis, minimum viable product development, business models, intellectual property, and capital raises, are covered. Assessments include individual reading quizzes, frequent group presentations, as well as a midterm and final.</p>
                        <p><b>Key Takeaways:</b> It’s well known that teaching content is an effective way to assess your own understanding. By requiring students to give frequent presentations on what they’ve learned, you’re giving students a flexible way of proving that they’ve learned the content as well as introducing group interactions. Since students are speaking out loud, you can also ask questions to students that you feel may not be understanding the curriculum entirely, providing both a good assessment strategy as well as aiding student learning and socialization. Students were also offered bonus points for attending entrepreneur meet-ups outside of class. Many students chose to attend them and formed close friendships with each other.</p>
